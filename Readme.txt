HOW TO OPERATE THE SOFTWARE
    The Software folder contains an executable file called 'Software.exe'. The user needs to run this file to start the software. The software is designed for the Windows Operating System only.
    In the event that the software fails to work, the folder also includes a python script with the name 'Software.py'. This script contains the main code behind the program.


HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE
    To use the software, the user needs to first choose the algorithm to use for encrypting and decrypting. This can be done by clicking on the buttons with the names of the algorithms on them.
    Once clicked, the encryption and decryption options will appear. The user may fill in the key and the message/cipher and then click on the submit button. Once this is done, the calculated cipher/message will be displayed.

    Note(Caesar Cipher): The key refers to the amount of displacement of the letters in the message/cipher. It must be a numeric character only.

    Note(Data Encryption Standard): The key can be any sequence of numbers and characters. The important feature is that the key used must be of 8 characters in length.

HOW THE SOFTWARE WAS CREATED
    The software was created keeping in mind the major software development techniques. The program utilises the programming paradigm of Object Oriented Programming(OOP). Naturally the program uses several classes and their methods to come about a solution. The program uses two custom built classes for Caesar Cipher and PlayFair Cipher. The Links have been added below. In addition to this, the DES algorithm has been implemented using a pure DES algorithm implementation program written by .The links to the repository has also been added below.

    The GUI has been created using the python Tkinter library.
